# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms


## Description
This project aims to teach you Search algorithms.


## Project Structure

The project consists of several tasks that need to be completed using both c scripts.


## Tasks

- **Task 0:** Linear search.
- **Task 1:** Binary search.
- **Task 2:** Big O "What is the time complexity (worst case) 
			  of a linear search in an array of size n?". 
- **Task 3:** Big O "What is the space complexity (worst case) 
			  of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n".
- **Task 4:** Big O "What is the time complexity (worst case) 
			  of a binary search in an array of size n?".
- **Task 5:** Big O "What is the space complexity (worst case) 
			  of a binary search in an array of size n?".
- **Task 6:** Big O "What is the space complexity of this function / algorithm?".
- **Task 7:** Jump search.
- **Task 8:** Big O "What is the time complexity (average case) 
			  of a jump search in an array of size n, using step = sqrt(n)?".
- **Task 9:** Interpolation search.
- **Task 10:** Exponential search.
- **Task 11:** Advanced binary search.
- **Task 12:** Jump search in a singly linked list.
- **Task 13:** Linear search in a skip list.
- **Task 14:** Big O "What is the time complexity (average case) 
			   of a jump search in a singly linked list of size n, using step = sqrt(n)?".
- **Task 15:** Big O "What is the time complexity (average case) 
               of a jump search in a skip list of size n, with an express lane using step = sqrt(n)?".
